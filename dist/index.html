<!-- We will start with creating a distribution folder. 
 The folder will be used to serve your application from a 
 local or remote web server later on. Serving the app makes it
 possible to view it in the browser or to host it on an external 
 hosting server which makes it accessible for everyone via HTTP. 
 After all, the distribution folder will be everything you need to 
 publish your web application. -->
